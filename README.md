## Inspired by WHM Bubble Breathing which unfortunately changed to subscription only.
- @WimHof: "Dude, I love you man! I made the 30 days challenge and believe everyone should chip in to help your cause but I had to make an alternative to your breathing bubble... no hard feelings!"

- The ignorant work for their own profit, Arjuna; the wise work for the welfare of the world, without thought for themselves.
